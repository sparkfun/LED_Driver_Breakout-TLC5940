[*SparkFun LED Driver Breakout -TLC5940(BOB-10616)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10616)

 The TLC5940 is a 16 channel PWM unit with 12 bit duty cycle control (0-4095), 6 bit current limit control (0-63), and a daisy chainable serial interface. 
 This breakout board is a good way to take full advantage of this useful IC. 
 All 16 PWM channels are broken out to standard 0.1" headers, which run alongside convenient voltage and ground rails.
